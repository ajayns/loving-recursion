The year is 2008, I am too young and too plump. It’s around 11 in a winter morning, 8th grade’s Mathematics class is underway, and we are being taught Boolean Algebra. Something I had already learned and passed the examination for 2 years ago; before I changed to the school I am at now.

Somehow, inexplicably, I was taught in 6th grade in my old school, what I am being taught in 8th grade in my new school. Quite surprising, owing to the fact that both schools followed the same national curriculum. What membrane of change in the education system I chanced to have went through, I am not aware.

This unfair mismatch put me at least 2 years ahead of my classmates in my new school, I scored straight As without trying, topped every class and my Science teacher was sure that in 10 years I’d be on my way to the moon.

One fact about my first school that I happened to learn years later was that it was established as a Jesuit establishment by Father John Moore, a missionary then only 32 years old.

Owing to the Jesuit background, the school along with just “teachers” had teachers whom we called Sisters, Fathers and Brothers. I am sure there’s history and reasons behind these adjectives but that never tickled my curiosity. I remember this not only because I find it quirky, but because after all my years of trudging through formal education, one thing that has stuck with me is memory of a Brother, whose name I now forget, and the classes he took, which I’ll never forget.

I can’t remember Brother’s face, I don’t know where he is now or what he does. (I am sorry Brother, I should’ve kept in touch) All I remember is that he was tall, thin and he could play guitar. He taught us Hindi Grammar in the 5th grade.

As un-interesting as Grammar can be, what made 10 year olds abhor it was memorising tables that were later asked in the exams, word-by-word letter-by-letter. Brother to us was an angel with a guitar who turned all the tables into songs. Hindi Grammar classes became 45 minutes long bi-weekly orchestra sessions of 50 children singing songs with no decipherable lyrics; with a thin guy – almost as thin as the guitar – strumming it in-front of the blackboard. At times it was hard to tell the difference between Brother and his guitar’s outer frame. And when teachers from other boring classes with their glasses hanging from their noses barged in asking us to shush it, we would all plaster our tiny palms with saliva trying to suppress the giggles.

That’s one good memory. Even though 10 year old me’s legs would shake like an out of control dildo at the passing thought of public speaking, I wanted to be in-front of the blackboard doing what brother was doing.

15 years later, I still remember those Grammar tables, word-by-word letter-by-letter. Though I am afraid, if you asked me to,  I won’t be able to recite them without singing and strumming an air guitar, or, will be able to tell you exactly what the table means.

So, if dare I to judge the utility of the class, it was memorable and fun, check. The information that was supposed to be transferred, was transferred, check. The thing that was missing, in my opinion backed by my absolute expertise in the field of education, was knowledge about the transferred information.

It’s like Malcolm Gladwell says ..

Malcom Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. His books are a product of first, his thoughts of course, many interviews and research papers. Now if you’ve downloaded, printed, stacked the papers up real nice and stapled the top left and sat to read a research paper only to go “what the fuck” five minutes later. You know it’s hard, numbers and graphs and lines. But the same research funneled through Malcolm comes out interesting and exciting. Because Gladwell knows how to make you care for those numbers. “Everyone likes numbers”, says Malcom, “the matter is to make the reader to appreciate it”.

With fun and memorable segway into what fun means.

Fun and Memorable doesn’t mean everyone wears clown hats and brightly colored balloons are involved. Not necessarily. Neither does it mean to include risque words like dildo. A weird historical fact or two or just something you can disucss in an elevator with a friend is enough to make the information interesting.

I know what Boolean Algebra is and how it works, I have sat through all the required classes, and in case you’ve forgotten, TWICE. But I am pretty sure it was a drag and I wouldn’t want to remember it as fondly as the Brother’s class, not to say that becoming a pleasant memory should be a top priority for a class. But still, if you aim for the stars you might fuck around and land on the moon, which isn’t bad at all.

A connection with the conveyed information, how it connects with other concepts and fits in a whole is as important a part of teaching as fun and memorable and crystal clear transfer of information is. These are three basis I have tried to judge education on. And now having been taught Boolean algebra twice, in two different schools, and even though I understand Boolean algebra well, I’d rate both the classes pretty mediocre because none of the classes mentioned what a nut-job George Boole’s wife was, and how she essentially killed him, in good intention of course.

In this book, which is my first book. We will try to learn Recursion together. The book is called Loving Recursion, which is a reference to the movie Loving Vincent. Vincent Van Gogh —the painter —  was magical, but difficult to understand and to get along with, like recursion is. But, we will eventually, in the course of 9 chapters, fall in love with it together.

This book is open source, so if you find a mistake, you can fix it. The programming language used is JavaScript, but I have made sure you can follow along easily with any other language as well. You can download the code to follow along here. If you go by statistics, the ratio of number of lines of code to normal English lines is 3:100. Which means to explain 3 lines of code I have written 100 lines of English. I hope you not only learn recursion, but a myriad of other things too. And I hope you don’t get bored and I hope if you’re not already. See you in Chapter 1.
