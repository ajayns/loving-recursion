A couple of thousand years ago, two chimps accidentally struck or saw two stones striking each other, in a way that produced a bright glow between the surfaces of the stones. The first chimp marveled at it in the ways his tiny chimp brain was capable of marveling, probably tilted his head in amazement too, but then, went back to chewing branches.

The other chimp was part of a chimp community, which was undergoing development in a language of sorts, a way of communicating and sharing things. “Aha-ooh-oh-kuu-kkuuh” for example, meant: “Which one of you sons of bitches ate my yogurt?”. Seeing the glow from the two stones striking tempted a part of the second chimp’s brain to share it with his friends in the community. And because they already had an excuse for a language, he could.

Having been taught about this latest happening, playing around and collaborating, this small community of chimps eventually discovered fire, then agriculture. Domesticated animals, built a civilization, and invented sophisticated languages. The language in which I am narrating a very inaccurate story to you right now happens to be one of them.

Sharing, teaching, collaborating, lighting one candle with another. That’s how we have managed to come so far. Teaching and sharing of information then is something we all should be reasonably good at, or at least not bad at. Now to narrow it down further: Especially those who have chosen teaching as a profession should be good at it. But, recall experiences from your childhood or your days in an educational institution and it wouldn’t take long to realize that, that is not always the case.

Why?

There’s gifts and there’s gift shops, there are pets and there’s pet shops. In the case of former, we’re quite aware that gift shops are not the only place to buy gifts from, in the case of latter, tough, counting pet shops out, leaves a very few places you can get a pet from.

There’s education and then there are Educational Institutions . In my life, I have been through 3 educational institutions. I started at a school, changed to another in the 6th grade and then on to a university for an undergraduate degree. With this average experience that most of us carry, I can say that it’s more of a … gift and gift shop situation going on here. Even if society is structured to make it look like education and educational institutions are correlated like pet and pet shops.

One fact about my first school that I happened to learn years later was that it was established as a Jesuit establishment by Father John Moore, a missionary then only 32 years old.

Owing to the Jesuit/Christian background, the school along with just teachers, had teachers whom we called Sisters, Fathers, and Brothers. I am sure there are history and reasons behind these adjectives but that never tickled my curiosity.

I remember this not only because I find it quirky, but because after all my years of trudging through formal education, one thing that has stuck with me is memory of a Brother, whose name I now forget, and the classes he took, some of which I’ll never forget.

I can’t remember Brother’s face, I don’t know where he is now or what he does. (I am sorry Brother, I should’ve kept in touch). All I remember is that he was tall, thin and he could play guitar. He taught us Hindi Grammar in the 5th grade.

As un-interesting as Grammar can be, what made 10-year-olds abhor it was memorising tables that were later asked in the exams, word-by-word letter-by-letter. Brother to us was an angel with a guitar who turned all the tables into songs, so they can be memorised easily. Hindi Grammar classes became 45 minutes long bi-weekly orchestra sessions of 50 children singing songs with no decipherable lyrics; with a thin guy — almost as thin as the guitar — strumming it in-front of the blackboard. At times it was hard to tell the difference between Brother and his guitar’s outer frame. And when teachers from other boring classes barged in asking us to shush it, we would all plaster our tiny palms with saliva trying to suppress the giggles.

15 years later, I still remember those Grammar tables, word-by-word letter-by-letter. Though I am afraid, if you asked me to, I won’t be able to recite them without singing and strumming an air guitar, or, will be able to tell you exactly what the table means and how to use it.

So, if dare I to judge the utility of Brother’s class, it was
(1) fun and memorable — check.
(2) The information that was supposed to be transferred (the contents of the table), was transferred — check.
The thing that was missing, in my opinion, was,
(3) knowledge about the transferred information (what does the table mean? and what to use it for?).

These are the three imperative constituents I have found in good teaching. The classes I have enjoyed and those which have filled me with immense interest for, and knowledge about the subject have included all 3 in some form. Most of such learning, for me unfortunately has come from humans I have never personally interacted with. Mehran Sahami, Walter Lewin, Sal Khan to name a few. If an objective measure exists, they are all good teachers.

From the sum total of experiences of people I know and mine, good teachers are rare to come by, which is also to say, you will almost inevitably collide into bad ones.

Like, or unlike most other professions we have fewer teachers who want to teach and more of the ones who _have_ to teach. To make a living or because someone they knew owns a school or knew someone who’s a headmaster at a school.

We have society and its icky adages to contribute to the misfortune.

“Those who can do, do, those who can’t, teach”.
Though I haven’t ever acted upon the urge, every-time I hear this I find my fingers curled into tight fists and my eyes searching for flat surfaces to bang, as hard as I can, as loud as my bones can bear. Of course … that’s an exaggeration. It’s more of a subtle surprised annoyance. It’s like you swat a fly, and with the swatter still in your hand another one comes in a-buzzin’, it’s the way you look at the second fly and whisper, “Are you stupid?”.

We don’t understand that it’s a blessing to find something interesting. And it’s a rare brush on the head with the hand of the big old universe itself to find something so interesting that you’d want to share it, that you’d want to teach it. Something that you see and an urge to show it to the ones who can’t. Those who can do, do, those who can teach, can do it better and can even make your sons and daughters do it.

An interest or interests, and a demented itch to share them. That’s all it takes to be a good teacher. Not degrees. Not fancy orange ties.

Thankfully things have changed with the advent of technology. Teaching is no longer a one to a hundred, or two-hundred act. It’s one to millions. A book, an article, an online course, or a recorded lecture can be simultaneously watched and absorbed by millions anywhere. A human with the itch can put it online, and another with a thirst can find it, in milliseconds.

At this very moment, you are reading this by no one’s will but your own.

I am teaching something that I want to teach, you are learning something that you want to learn. And when stars align in this fashion, baby! We don’t need walled institutions or headmistresses, we don’t need sticks, we don’t need grades, we don’t even need recess.

This book is an experiment in my teaching methodologies, in the three imperative constituents that I discussed above. Since it’s an experiment, the book is free. Although, if you feel obligated enough to make a monetary transaction, you can donate how much ever you like to OCW or Khan Academy. Tweet me a screenshot of the donation. It will make my week. It truly will, you have no idea.

In this book, we will learn Recursion together. While books and courses on frameworks and technologies are getting popular, something like recursion which is a part of core computer science, among many other important topics is being left behind. Therefore, what you’ll learn in this book isn’t something that will necessarily help you land a dev job. It’s purely for the love of programming and appreciating the beauty of it. Actually, I want this book to not help you get anywhere in your career, I want you to read this book because you’re enjoying it. And if that enjoyment ruptures at any word in any chapter, I want you to open Twitter and tell me that I have failed.

This book is an open-source project, so if you find a mistake, you can fix it. The programming language used is JavaScript, but I have made sure you can follow along easily in any other language as well. If you go by statistics, the ratio of the number of lines of code to English lines is 3:100. This means to explain 3 lines of code I have written 100 lines of English. I hope you not only learn recursion but a myriad of other things too.
