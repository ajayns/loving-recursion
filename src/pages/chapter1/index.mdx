The projecting piece on a sundial that shows the time by the position of its shadow, is called a Gnomon.

Gnomon, like "Hat," is just an English word; it's not a specific term for a piece of sundial's anatomy. For example, Gnomon is also the word the Greeks used for odd numbers. Possibly because of the following observation.

If you were to take an odd number of things, say 7 pebbles, and lay them out in two rows…

![7 pebbles laid out in two rows](2.png)

… you will notice a pebble projecting out of an otherwise even shape. Forming a Gnomon.

And conversely, if you lay an even number of pebbles, say 8, in two rows, you'll find an even rectangular shape.

This is supposedly the origin of the concept of even and odd numbers, or of their names at least.

Much later, Euclid, a Math grandmaster, formalized even numbers as: "An even number is that which is divisible into two equal parts." And the numbers that cannot be divided into two equal parts are odd.

If you have ever written a computer program that checks whether a number is even, you have - maybe without knowing - eluded to Euclid's definition of even numbers.

```javascript
let isEven = function (number) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    // If the number when divided by 2 leaves no remainder or,
    // if the number is divisible by two
    return true // it is an even number
  } else {
    // else
    return false // it is not
  }
}
```

Before we move forward, let's be honest, the code you see above is unnecessarily verbose. It can be written more succinctly like so:

```javascript
let isEven = function (number) {
  return number % 2 === 0
}
```

And that's exactly how you should be writing your code. But I want the book and the code written in it to be readable by programmers at all levels. If anywhere in the book, you think there's a better way to write the same code, don't hold yourself back.

Returning to our discussion about even and odd numbers, let's consider the number `0`, we know that `0` is an even number as it is divisible by `2`, `(0/2 = 0)`.

Now what we can do with `0`, is use it as an anchor in the natural sequence of numbers, starting from which the even and odd numbers alternate.

We can make two rudimentary observations about even and odd numbers from the natural sequence.

1. **A number `n` is even if it is either `0` or if the number before it is odd.**
2. **A number is odd if it's not even.**

Let's start with the first observation.

The observation is, if you pick any random number in the sequence, it is even only if it is `0` or the number before the chosen number is odd.

Take `8`, for example. Is `8` even? For that, `8` has to pass at least one of the two checks.

1.  Is `8` `0`? No! -  _Failed_
2.  Is the number before `8` `(8–1 = 7)` odd? Yes! `7` is an odd number.

Since one of the checks pass, `8`, in fact, is an even number.
Translating that into code we get,

```javascript
let isEven = function (number) {
  if (number === 0) {
    // A number is even if it is either 0...
    return true
  } else {
    // ..or The number preceding it i.e. number - 1...
    return isOdd(number - 1) // ..is odd.
  }
}
```

"That's a kind of a spooky way to write code, isn't it, Nash?" Yes, seems like it. Let me go ahead and write both the functions (`isOdd` and `isEven`) together in a succinct way; see if you understand it better.
