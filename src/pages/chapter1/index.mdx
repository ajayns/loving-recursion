The projecting piece on a sundial that shows the time by the position of its shadow is called a Gnomon.

Gnomon, like "Hat", is just an English word, it's not a specific term for a piece
of sundial's anatomy. For example, Gnomon is also the word the Greeks used for odd
numbers. Possibly because of the following observation.

If you were to take an odd number of things, say 7 pebbles, and lay them out in two rows…

... you will notice a pebble projecting out of an otherwise even shape. Forming a Gnomon.

And conversely, if you lay an even number of pebbles, say 8, in two rows you’ll find an _even_ rectangular shape.

This is supposedly the origin of the concept of even and odd numbers, or of their names at least.
Much later, Euclid, a Math grandmaster formalized the definition of even numbers as: "An even number is that which is divisible into two equal parts".

And the numbers that cannot be divided into two equal parts are odd numbers.

If you have ever written a computer program that checks whether a number is even you have - maybe without knowing - eluded to Euclid's definition of even numbers.

```javascript{1}
function isEven(number) {
  // a function to check if a number is even (isEven?)
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    // If the number when divided by 2 leaves no remainder or, if the number is divisible by two
    return true // it is an even number
  } else {
    // else
    return false // it is not
  }
}
```
